	## Markdown Site Repository Template
	This is the homepage for the nsm site repository template **markdown-site** [[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/nsm-templates/basic-site), [GitHub](https://github.com/nsm-templates/basic-site), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/nsm-templates/basic-site)]. [Nift](https://nift.cc) (aka nsm) is a cross-platform open source git-like and $\LaTeX$-like site manager coded in C++.

	This website uses [Showdown](http://showdownjs.com/) to convert Markdown to HTML.

	You can import (or fork and rename) the **markdown-site** site repository template to begin making your own website with the same design.

	To use emojis you need to enable the **"emoji"** option, then emojis are eg. `:smile:`, `:+1:`, `:bacon:` and `:zap:` for :smile:, :+1:, :bacon: and :zap:. See [here](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/emojis) for a list of Showdown supported emojis.
