To install nsm see the [Nift install](https://nift.cc/documentation/installing_nsm.html) pages. You can learn more about managing sites from the [getting started guide](https://nift.cc/resources/get_started.html), [Nift commands](https://nift.cc/documentation/nsm_commands.html), [content files](https://nift.cc/documentation/content_files.html), [template files](https://nift.cc/documentation/template_files.html) and [Nift tutorial](https://nift.cc/documentation/nsm_tutorial.html) pages from the nsm documentation. The simpler things you may wish to do are below.

### How do I add a page to my site?
1. From the terminal navigate your way to the site directory.
2. Enter <mono>nsm track page-name (page-title)</mono> where <mono>page-name</mono> is the name of the page file (including any directories) and optionally <mono>page-title</mono> is the title of the page. If you would like the page in a directory use page name <mono>dir-name/page-name</mono>.

### How do I remove a page from my site?
1. From the terminal navigate your way to the site directory.
2. Enter <mono>nsm rm page-name</mono> where <mono>page-name</mono> is the name of the page file (including any directories).

### How do I modify a page on my site?
1. Modify the content file <mono>content/page-name.content</mono>.
2. From the terminal navigate your way to the site directory.
3. To view changes locally enter <mono>nsm build-updated</mono> to build the updated pages, then view the site locally (see the [FAQ](@pathto(faq)) page for how).
4. To push the changes remotely, enter <mono>nsm bcp "commit message"</mono>. Note <mono>bcp</mono> will build the updated changes locally, commit the changes to your local repository and push the changes to the remote repository, which after a short delay will update your site online.
